# Running the Application Locally


1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) are installed

2. `git clone git@github.com:chriscerk/study-mc.git`

3. `cd study-mc`

4. `npm install`

5. `ng serve` 

6. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

7. Create a file named `firebase.config.ts` and put it in the `/src/environments/` folder

8. Get your firebase credentials and insert as:

`export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "",
    authDomain: "your-app-name.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://your-app-name.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "your-app-name",
    storageBucket: "your-app-name.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: ""
  };`

# Development

### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.


# Deploying the Application

1. `npm run deploy`

2. Open FileZilla, delete everything in the `/study-mc/` folder.

2. Copy the contents of the `dist` directory to the server through FileZilla.


# File Structure

## src/app/
`src/app` is where the bulk of the application lives. 

### core
Within `core` are modules that are only loaded once. `core/services` contains the modules that allow StudyMC to load the data and "talk" with Firebase.

### shared
`shared` contains modules that are shared across the application. `shared/models` might be useful to view to see how the data is organized.

## src/assets
`src/assets` is where content which is stored by the Service Worker resides such as images and JSON files. 

## dist
`dist` is generated by a `ng build` command or `npm run deploy` and is where your production code lives`

## scripts
`scripts` is for any custom JS scripts. Currently there is `canvasHotspots` which is used for hovering over compounds to show information. `fabricProcessor` is a library I created for making interactions with HTML5 canvas using FabricJS. Both `canvasHotspots` and `fabricProcessor` implement animations simply from data.

# Other Information

### Images

For each Topic in a Course, the images are stored in `assets/media/compounds/`. For each new topic added to a course, a new folder must be created WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE TOPIC in this location. Images for that topic must be placed inside of the new folder. 


### Data

Data currently pulls from a Firebase connection for everything except 'Learn'. Data can be pulled from the `assets/data/` folder easily by using the respective functions in the `app/core/services` folder. Firebase allows the user to update the data instead of the data being statically served as a JSON file like the Learn Component.
